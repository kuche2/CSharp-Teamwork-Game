Space Invaders game introduction
Space Invaders, arcade game created by Japanese engineer and game designerNishikado Tomohiro in 1978 and produced by Japanese electronic gamemanufacturer Taito Corp. The objective of Space Invaders, which was one of the earliest video games released, is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens, preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen. It is viewed as a pioneer of modern gaming.
Space Invaders is a very simple game by modern standards, but it was a technological marvel in its time. Typical levels consist of a player piloting a laser cannon to battle columns of descending aliens while using shields to block alien fire. The speed of the alien approach increases as the game progresses, adding to the tension. A bonus alien spaceship appears from time to time, which offers the player an opportunity to score additional points by blowing it up.
Space Invaders was a worldwide success and paved the way for a generation of shooting games that became extremely popular. In Japan demand for the arcade game was so great that it led to a coin shortage and prompted an increase in production of the 100-yen coin. In 1980 American game manufacturer Atari, Inc., adapted a version of the game for the Atari 2600 console, fueling the popularity of home gaming. Countless sequels, spin-offs, and releases of Space Invaders have been generated over the years, including Taito’s Space Raiders (2003). In 2008, in celebration of the game’s 30th anniversary, Nintendo released Space Invaders Get Even, an online game available in Japan for the company’s Wii console, in which players take control of the invading aliens rather than the defending laser cannon. 

The Real Game Introduction
Spider Invaders Killer

The version of the game that is going to be demonstrated to you consists spiders as enemies, not aliens. You will again have the ability to fight enemies with different that different kind of difficulty. Three lives is your life span, each live containing ten(10) health bars. As you progress further in the game, based on your points amount you will notice that the game will become faster, just as you, have not figured out that every video game wants to suck your most abilities to play it. In other words – you will suffer.

Space invaders walks a long way from that 1987. Until we reach the beginning of 21st century for that ultimate remake of the game, made by only seven noble people from a not that simple Academy called Telerik. The game is called Spider Invaders Killer and it’s release is scheduled for the 4th of march 2015, Sofia, Bulgaria at Telerik Academy in the room they called Light.
